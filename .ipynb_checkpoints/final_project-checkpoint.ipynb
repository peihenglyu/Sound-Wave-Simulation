    "Method: Simulating Sound Waves with Mesh Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo for this project can be viewed in the sound.html file included in the submission. (The animation may not be completely stable, so if it becomes slow or crashes, please refresh the page.) In the animation, a 3D room is simulated, with sound waves represented by numerous points. These points mimic the physical behavior of sound waves at a lower resolution. The main idea behind this method is to capture the reverberation characteristics of any 3D space, as long as the boundaries of the space are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 1: Point Movement\n",
    "    The positions of the points are updated using the formula x[i] = x[i-1] + v * dt, where x[i] represents the position of a point at frame i, v is the velocity of sound, and dt is the time difference between each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 2: Tracked Gain\n",
    "    The gain of each point is also tracked. When a point is detected by the microphone, its delay and gain can be determined. Points with lower gain values will have reduced opacity until they disappear completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 3: Microphone Simulation\n",
    "    The microphone shares the same position as the sound source, represented by a static red point. When a sound wave point is within a certain distance threshold from the microphone, it will also be displayed in red. This allows for a visual representation of points detected by the microphone."

    "Conslusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method offers a relatively reasonable simulation of sound waves in a 3D space, with both advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pros:\n",
    "    1. Versatility: This approach can be applied to various spaces, as long as the shape of the space is provided.\n",
    "    2. Customizable resolution: Users can balance the accuracy of the results and computational cost by adjusting the resolution of the sound wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cons:\n",
    "    1. Performance dependency: The animation relies on real-time rather than system time, meaning that the accuracy of the data and the smoothness of the animation can be affected by the performance of the browser and computer. Lower frame rates may lead to unexpected results.\n",
    "    2. Simplified sound wave capture: The current method of tracking sound waves by monitoring the distance between points and the microphone might not be realistic enough. A more accurate approach would involve connecting points to form a sphere-like object and tracking whether any part of the object's surface has passed through the microphone's position. This could potentially yield better results."

    "    1. Separate sound and microphone: Allow the sound source and microphone to be placed at different locations for a more realistic simulation.\n",
    "    2. Multiple sound sources: Introduce multiple sound sources to explore complex sound wave interactions.\n",
    "    3. Improved gain loss simulation: Currently, the gain is reduced based on the distance a point has traveled. A system should be implemented to simulate gain loss when sound waves bounce back from walls. This would provide a more accurate representation of how sound waves lose energy as they propagate through the environment and reflect off surfaces."
